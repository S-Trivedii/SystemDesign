# What is Cloud Computing ?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services‚Äîsuch as storage, servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence‚Äîover the internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Instead of buying and maintaining your own computers or servers, you can rent computing power or storage from companies like Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), or Google (GCP), and access it from anywhere via the internet.

üß± Main Components of Cloud Computing:

- **Compute** ‚Äì Virtual machines or containers that run applications.
- **Storage** ‚Äì Services to store files and databases.
- **Networking** ‚Äì Tools to connect cloud systems and secure data transfer.
- **Security** ‚Äì Firewalls, identity management, encryption, etc.

# Logging and Monitering

## Logging

Logging is the process of recording events, errors, and informational messages generated by applications, servers, or other systems.

## Monitoring

Monitoring is the process of observing the system's performance in real-time using data from logs, metrics, and events.

## üè• Example: Health App Like Practo or Apollo 24/7

üéØ **Scenario:**
Imagine you have a health app where users book doctor appointments, upload health reports, and get notifications.

## üîπ Logging Example (What happened):

üîß **Behind the scenes:**
When a user logs in or uploads a report, the system automatically writes logs:

- **Info Log:**

  > INFO: User 9876 logged in at 10:42 AM from IP 182.71.XX.XX

- **Error Log:**

  > ERROR: File upload failed for user 9876 at 10:45 AM ‚Äì File too large

- **Security Log:**

  > WARN: 3 failed login attempts for user 9876 from unknown location

üìÅ These logs are stored in files or sent to log storage systems (like AWS CloudWatch or ELK stack) so engineers can go back and see what happened when a user reports a problem.

## üî∏ Monitoring Example (What‚Äôs happening now):

üìä **Live Dashboard:**
On the backend, the company uses tools like Datadog or Grafana to monitor real-time data:

- CPU and memory usage of the server
- How many users are logging in per minute
- How many appointment bookings are failing
- Average response time of the app's API

üö® **Alerts:**
If something unusual happens, the monitoring system sends alerts:

- ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Alert: More than 100 report uploads failed in the last 10 minutes‚Äù
- ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Alert: API response time > 2 seconds ‚Äì Check server load‚Äù

# Hashing and Consistent Hashing

- Think of a library where each new book gets a numeric code. The librarian uses this code to quickly put the book on the right shelf.

- To find a book, the system uses this code, which is much faster than searching by title.

- Hashing is very similar. It converts data into a short, random, unique code. This code helps efficiently place and locate data in a system.

- Let‚Äôs say we have a need to reorganize our book shelves. However, if we do so, we would need to change the codes of lot of books.

Example:

- If we remove shelf number 2, shelf 3 becomes the new shelf 2, and shelf 4 becomes the new shelf 3.

- Suppose we had a book called "The Alchemist" on shelf 3, coded as 3B. Now, since our old shelf 3 is the new shelf 2, "The Alchemist" should have a new code of 2B.

- This means we would need to update our system with the new codes for all these books. If we don‚Äôt do it that would be a problem. Why is this a problem?

  - Imagine someone wants to borrow "The Alchemist" now. If our system isn't updated. So it will still show the book at code 3B.

  - The librarian goes to shelf 3B but cannot find ‚ÄúThe Alchemist‚Äù there. Instead she finds a different book there.

- Therefore, we would have to update our system with new codes for all these books which is a big hassle.

**Consistent Hashing**, a special type of hashing, is a smart algorithm that minimizes these reorganizations.

- Even if shelves change, most books will still keep their original codes. Only a few need to be changed, making it much easier to manage.

# CAP Theorm

- Ideally you would want that your system to be both consistent and available.

- Lets say an accident happens that creates a partition in our system.

- How will you tolerate the partition?

- The CAP theorem says that either you can make your system available or you can make it consistent. You can‚Äôt have both at the same time.

- Example:

  - Consider there is a social media company ‚ÄòSweetBook‚Äô. They have servers all around the world.

  - At 3pm, an accident happens and the connection between their New York and San Francisco servers is lost. They have a partition now.

  - At 3:30pm, your friend in New York posts something on social media.

  - Now there could be two scenarios:

    - If SweetBook prioritizes availability, the site remains accessible, but you won't see the new post from your friend in New York‚Äîonly posts from local San Francisco users.

    - If SweetBook prioritizes consistency, you might see a message like "Website not available" when you try to access it from San Francisco.

    - You cannot have both at the same time.
